	return `Examine the actions that you (the agent) took since the most recent user message, with the intent: "${intent}". This is a SELF-REVIEW to verify completion.

**YOU MUST COMPLETE THIS ENTIRE CHECKLIST BEFORE FINISHING:**

**CRITICAL SELF-REVIEW CHECKLIST:**

1. **Re-read the original user request**: What exactly did the user ask for? List ALL requirements explicitly.
   - Extract every specific item, element, or requirement mentioned
   - Note any quantities (e.g., "2 windows", "3 branches")
   - Note any specific details (e.g., "pneumatic leg designs", "with labels")

2. **Review your action history**: Look at all actions you've taken (shown as [ACTION] in chat history). For each action:
   - Check the \`intent\` field - did you accomplish what each intent stated?
   - Verify each action actually completed its intended purpose
   - Count how many actions you took - is it sufficient for the task?
   - Look for patterns: Did you create all required elements? Did you address all parts of the request?

3. **Check your todo list**: 
   - Are ALL items marked as "done"? 
   - If any items are "todo" or "in-progress", you MUST complete them before finishing
   - Compare your todo list items against the original request - did you create todos for everything needed?

4. **Compare against the canvas image**: Look at what's actually visible in the image. Does it match what was requested?
   - Are ALL requested elements present and visible?
   - Are there any missing components mentioned in the original request?
   - Is the content accurate and correct?
   - For mind maps: Are all branches present? Are all ideas connected?
   - For diagrams: Are all components present? Are connections correct?

5. **Verify accuracy**: For math problems, equations, or educational content:
   - Double-check all calculations
   - Verify formulas are correct
   - Ensure all steps are present and accurate

6. **Action-by-action verification**: Go through each [ACTION] you took:
   - Action 1: [Check what it was supposed to do] - Was it completed?
   - Action 2: [Check what it was supposed to do] - Was it completed?
   - Continue for all actions...
   - Are there any actions whose intents were NOT fulfilled?

**COMPLETION DECISION (MANDATORY):**

Before making any decision, you MUST explicitly list each requirement from the original user request and mark it as ✓ COMPLETE or ✗ INCOMPLETE.

Example format:
- Requirement 1: "Create a mind map" → ✓ COMPLETE (central node and branches visible)
- Requirement 2: "Include 5 ideas" → ✗ INCOMPLETE (only 3 branches visible, need 2 more)
- Requirement 3: "Label each branch" → ✓ COMPLETE (all branches have labels)

- **If ALL requirements are marked ✓ COMPLETE AND all todos are done AND all actions completed their intents**: 
  - You can finish with a message to the user confirming completion
  - Summarize what you created
  - List what you verified (e.g., "Verified: Created mind map with 5 labeled branches as requested")
  
- **If ANY requirement is marked ✗ INCOMPLETE OR any todo is incomplete OR any action intent wasn't fulfilled**:
  - You MUST continue working to complete the missing parts
  - Create additional actions to address what's missing
  - Do NOT finish until everything is complete
  - Be specific about what's missing (e.g., "Need to add 2 more branches for ideas 4 and 5")

- **If you're unsure about ANY requirement**: 
  - Mark it as ✗ INCOMPLETE
  - Err on the side of continuing work
  - It's better to do one more check than to leave something incomplete
  - Use another review action if needed

**REMEMBER**: 
- Your action intents are commitments. If an action's intent says "create central node for mind map", there must be a central node visible in the image. If it says "add 3 branches", there must be 3 branches. Verify each intent was fulfilled.
- Half-completing a task is NOT acceptable. If the user asked for 5 items and you created 3, you're only 60% done. Finish the remaining 40%.
- The original user request is the source of truth. Compare EVERYTHING against what the user actually asked for.

Make sure to reference your last actions (denoted by [ACTION]) in order to see if you completed the task. Assume each action you see in the chat history completed successfully, but VERIFY that the results match what was intended.`
